                            First of all, I am an extrovert person. I can easily communicate with others. Also, others
                            feel good to communicate with me. As a person, I am an open-minded, practical, disciplined,
                            and dynamic person. I have a positive personality and that is why my friends and teammates
                            are always get motivated by me. I always create a positive atmosphere around me. That is why
                            others feel free to interact with me.
